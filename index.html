<p>
The library is a place where this expertise already exists. It is a much smaller leap for librarians to extend their existing expertise in these areas to apply to data, than it is for researchers to learn all these skills from scratch.

"The Data Catalog Collaboration Project (DCCP) helps researchers make their own data discoverable, and locate usable biomedical data that is not readily accessible elsewhere online. The DCCP is a collaboration of academic libraries working to highlight institutional biomedical research data using an open source catalog."
</p>

<p>
"[DCCP] metadata has been mapped to the Data Tag Suite (DATS) developed by NIH bioCADDIE to ensure that it can be indexed in national discovery systems like DataMed."

<p>
DCCP is a relatively new project with catalogs still rather small. 
Process of creating descriptions is labor intensive. 
At UNC, it has involved conducting interview with data creator.

"The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata." (<a href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">src</a>)

<p>
"ResourceSync is a self-describing set of capabilities designed to keep content in sync between a provider and consumer of that content. The capabilities of a ResourceSync endpoint can be adapted to meet specific community requirements as it extends the Sitemaps protocol used by Google and other search engines.
</p>

<p>
The project team has been motivated to leverage ResourceSync as an alternative, or next-generation, approach to harvesting repository metadata by aggregators. ResourceSync is attractive because it utilizes native qualities of the web to solve the problem of keeping web-published resources in sync as inevitable changes occur. Nothing special is required beyond publication of a sitemap and change lists, leveraging timestamps to indicate that changes have been published and when they occurred. We anticipated that it’d be an improvement over the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)."

"DDI [Data Documentation Initiative] encourages comprehensive description of data for discovery and analysis and supports effective data sharing. Because DDI is a structured standard, it facilitates machine-actionability and interoperability and it can actually be used to drive systems. Another feature of DDI is its focus on metadata reuse; “enter once, use often” means you can reuse metadata over the course of the data life cycle to avoid costly duplication of effort."

"The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated."

DATS is a platform-independent model also available as an annotated serialization in schema.org, which in turn is widely used by major search engines like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex."

<p>
" Description: In 1951, the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University became a partner in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program in order to collect oceanographic data in and near Monterey Bay. The aim of the program was to conduct joint fisheries-oceanographic cruises that would help researchers understand what contributed to observed fluctuations in the California sardine fishery. Hopkins condutced weekly sampling (more or less) continuously from March 1951 through June 1974. The raw and aggregated data for most of these cruises currently reside in analog form (handwritten data logs, annual reports, etc.) in the library at the Hopkins Marine Station. The dataset includes variables such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure and abundance, meteorological conditions, fish and marine mammal counts, and more. The collection includes forty-four 3-ring or loose-bound notebooks, twenty-two small, bound notebooks, minutes from annual meetings, annual data reports, and other ephemera. The Hopkins CalCOFI collection is large, completely analog, and very heterogeneous. We are in the early phases of planning a curation strategy, but our general objectives for the dataset are to digitize it, add metadata, convert sampling data to actionable formats, and make it all public.

<p>
<a href="https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets">HathiTrust Research Center Extracted Features Dataset</a> 
"HathiTrust Digital Library is a massive digital collection, comprising more than 15.8 million volumes, and growing. HathiTrust aims to leverage the scope and scale of the digital library to the benefit of research and scholarship. The collection includes considerable material under copyright or subject to licensing agreements, which prohibits HathiTrust from releasing much of it—either in the form of plain text files or scanned pages—as freely-available data. The HathiTrust Research Center therefore develops tools and services that open the collection to data-driven research while remaining within the bounds of copyright and licensing restrictions, allowing only non-consumptive research.
</p>

<p>
One way the Research Center approaches this goal is through tools and technical infrastructure that mediate access to the data, including web algorithms researchers can run on HathiTrust data, the HathiTrust+Bookworm visualization tool, and the HTRC Data Capsule secure computing environment. Results from a user-needs assessment for text analysis conducted by the Research Center, as well as anecdotal evidence from researchers affiliated with HTRC, evinced the value of flexible, open data for text analysis research. To this end, the Research Center released the HTRC Extracted Features Dataset in 2015, which includes metadata and data derived from the HathiTrust corpus. The derived “features” in the dataset include page count, line count, empty line count, counts of characters that begin and end lines, and part-of-speech tagged word counts. The first release (v.0.2) included 4.8 million public domain volumes from the collection, and second release (v.1.0) opened 13.7 million volumes from the collection, representing a snapshot of the entire HathiTrust Digital Library circa 2016.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Much text analysis research begins with the process of generating so-called features from the original text, which are then counted and calculated to draw conclusions about the data. HTRC Extracted Features aids the researcher by providing the data already in feature format. Furthermore, this shift in format from full text to features distills the contents of the volumes into facts and metadata, discarding the original expression of the full text. The Extracted Features dataset therefore strikes a balance of meeting the needs of researchers in a non-consumptive manner.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The resulting dataset includes: *For every volume: metadata, including bibliographic metadata, word counts, and page counts. *For every page in a volume: part-of-speech tagged tokens (words) and their counts. Metadata, including information about the page (number of lines, number of empty lines, counts of characters beginning and ending lines), and the language, which has been computationally determined.
</p>

<p>
HTRC Extracted Features are available in JSON format, where each file represents a volume. Within the JSON files, data is organized by page in the volume. JSON is a hierarchical file format popular for exchanging data, and it lends itself well to representing book data.
</p>

<p>
HTRC Extracted Features are available using rsync, which HathiTrust tends to use to share data and is considered an efficient file transfer protocol. Volumes download in pairtree format, a highly-nested directory structure.
</p>

<p>
The data can be retrieved with a structured URL that includes the standard HathiTrust volume identification number. The rsync URL format is: data.analytics.hathitrust.org::features/. More information about generating the rysnc URL can be found here: <a href="https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/x/oYDJAQ">https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/x/oYDJAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The HTRC Extracted Features dataset is useful for both research and teaching. As discussed in section 2 above, the feature format provides the data in a derived manner that aids the research process without over-mediating access to the data. As structured and pre-processed data, it does not meet the needs of all users, for example those whose work requires access to bigrams or greater, though it is useful for research that follows the bag-of-words model or that starts from token counts. Demonstrated uses have shown the data’s value in large-scale computational text analysis, such as text classification using machine learning techniques, and in-classroom for teaching data science and digital humanities. Exemplary uses are outlined below.
</p>

<p>
Text classification with HTRC Extracted Features
</p>

<p>
Ted Underwood at the University of Illinois has drawn on HTRC Extracted Features in his research on literary genres. His work in machine learning uses the features data, including words and word counts, characters, and computationally-inferred, page-level metadata, to make inferences about genre in HathiTrust. Dr. Underwood classified volumes in the broad categories of fiction, poetry, drama, nonfiction prose, and paratext. His work classified over 800,000 volumes at the page-level, and resulted in a derived dataset containing word counts by genre and by year for volumes from 1700-1922.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Pedagogical application of HTRC Extracted Features
</p>

<p>
Chris Hench and Cody Hennesy at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a module for the Berkeley Data Science Education Program that makes use of HTRC Extracted Features. In the first iteration of the module, students documented the use of Extracted Features in data visualization, mapping, and classification in Jupyter Notebooks. Their Notebooks will be re-used in the classroom over the next year. Chris will introduce the curriculum to students in his course, “Rediscovering Texts as Data.” In that multidisciplinary, digital humanities class, students will build on the existing Jupyter Notebooks as they develop coding skills. Chris also imagines using the Notebooks in workshops with non-programmers, where they will provide a legible introduction to text analysis by revealing how Python code is used to interact with the data without requiring attendees to program.

<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-library-apis-datasets"> Harvard Library Policy On Open Metadata</a>
</p>

<p>
The Harvard Library provides open access to library metadata, subject to legal and privacy factors. In particular, the Library makes available its own catalog metadata under appropriate broad use licenses. The Library Board is responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and modifying it as necessary.
</p>

<p>
This policy applies to all metadata that the library holds. For instance, the metadata from the DASH repository is also distributed under an open license.
</p>

<p>
Some metadata may have been placed under contractual obligations preventing distribution prior to the establishment of this policy. In such cases, of course, the library cannot legally, and will not, distribute the metadata beyond what such agreements allow.
</p>

<p>
Metadata that involves the usage of library materials by individual patrons will not be distributed without sufficient anonymization or aggregation to provide reasonable protection against the reconstruction of individual patron usage.
</p>

<p>
Because each metadata set may have individual legal and privacy characteristics, appropriate licenses are designed on an individual dataset basis. However, the goal is to make these licenses as broad as possible.

This presentation takes a little turn toward the dark side here, because I'm afraid we really are falling down on our professional code of ethics here, given the reality of the "surveillance capitalist" world in which we are embedded. 
</p>

<p>
On the 11th of this month Dorothea Salo gave a keynote talk at the Minnesota Library Association Annual Conference in which she pulled no punches pointing out the ways in which libraries are being complicit collaborators in this surveillance panopticon, including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>serving up insecure (http instead of https) library websites</li>
<li>having ad trackers (DoubleClick, Ad Nexus) installed in library websites and apps</li>
<li>using Google analytics, given Google's privacy track record</li>
<li>Enthusiastically buying in to "learning analytics" that rely on student surveillance to prove our value within our organizations</li>

</ul>

<p>
There are no easy answers here, though I agree with Salo that we need to remember that "No." can be an answer and a complete sentence.

<li>What data are we collecting?</li>
<li>Why are we collecting it? ("When you look at what data you are collecting, there should be a solid business need attached to that data being collected. Is there a measurable outcome that is being assessed for an application or service? Are there operational needs as to why you need this particular piece of information? Can those needs be met by collecting lower risk PII data from patrons, essentially finding lower risk proxies for high risk data?" &#x2013;Yoose, Wrangling Library Patron Data (Slide 14)</li>

</p>

<ul>
<li>De-identifcation methods do not provide adequate privacy protection for outliers in a service population, or a small overall service population or subset. Nor does it protect against identifiable patterns in the data (e.g. AOL search logs used to reconstruct specific identities belonging to distinct persons) &#x2013; or what identifiable data may emerge if your data set is matched up with another data set(eg NYC Taxicab data set + images from Google image search + other external data = identifying individual taxi passengers) (Yoose, Wrangling&#x2026;, slide 27, 38)</li>

</ul>


<p>
"Libraries have a complicated relationship with data. We believe that patrons must have privacy while using library services and resources, but the systems we use collect patron data that is highly sought after for analytics, marketing, and assessment needs for internal and external audiences. Libraries are then left to figure out how to meet data analytical and assessment needs of the organization without betraying patron trust in the library to protect their privacy. This talk, based on a case study at a large library system, will discuss many of the issues in balancing the need for analytical data while upholding patron privacy and library ethics, including: - De-identification of patron data, including strategies and the risks involved with several de-identification methods - Technical processes and structures for building and maintaining a data warehouse - Data and privacy policies and governance at the organizational level - Auditing what data is being collected by the library, from system logs to paper forms The talk will address how these issues impact libraries with both limited and extensive resources in their efforts to balance data analytical needs and patron privacy."

<li>Principles, Policies, and Practices</li>
<li>ALA Data Management Guidelines • Collection of personally identifiable information • only when necessary to fulfill the mission of the library • Should not share personally identifiable user information with third parties, unless • the library has obtained user permission • has entered into a legal agreement with the vendor • Make records available [to law enforcement agencies and officers] only in response to properly executed orders. “An interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights.” <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/privacy">http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/privacy</a></li>
<li>State Law: Revised Code of WA • RCW 42.56.310: Library Records • Any library record, the primary purpose of which is to maintain control of library materials, or to gain access to information, that discloses or could be used to disclose the identity of a library user is exempt from disclosure under this chapter. • RCW 19.255.010: Disclosure, notice — Definitions — Rights, remedies. • First &amp; last name combined with SSN, DL #, credit/debit card number, authentication credentials, “account number”</li>
<li>SPL Confidentiality of Patron Data • It is the policy of The Seattle Public Library to protect the confidentiality of borrower records as part of its commitment to intellectual freedom. • The Library will keep patron records confidential and will not disclose this information except • as necessary for the proper operation of the Library • upon consent of the user • pursuant to subpoena or court order • as otherwise required by law.

<li>“Unanswerable” Questions • Longitudinal questions (e.g. trended analysis) • Long-term (multi-year) rather than snapshot • Trends, correlations, changes in behavior – not necessarily individual activity • Questions only about the type of behavioral use of Library programs and services: •“Do teen patrons remain active in their 20s?” •“Do people use their neighborhood branch or use the branch where relevant materials are?” (e.g. Chinese language collection)</li>
<li>Privacy Requirements • Passionate commitment to intellectual freedom • Recognition that some patrons have no alternatives • Intellectual content of transactions should always be purged • Avoid keeping records that show person’s whereabouts</li>
<li>Threats to patron privacy • Law enforcement • Seeking intellectual pursuit data • Seeking patron whereabouts • Hackers • Library and ILS data • Data leak • Reconstruction of identity via data • Embarrassment/loss of trust • Notification costs</li>

<li>Belt &amp; suspenders • To identify a specific patron’s transaction, you’d need to • Breach ILS • Recreate hash algorithm • Breach data warehouse • Look up patron • Even then • No intellectual content or whereabouts • Only the fact of types of transactions • Strict, clear policies for staff</li>
<li>Data Warehouse Example</li>

<ul>
<li>Start on this early with each new agreement</li>
<li>If you haven't been on it from the start, consider working to add addendums to existing contracts/licenses, that address:
<ul>
<li>basic data standards we expect to be followed (HIPPA, COPPA, ALA Library Bill of Rights, etc.)</li>
<li>expected data disclosure and confidentiality practices</li>
<li>vendor liability for data breaches/leaks</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Can we take our data (and our patrons' data) with us if we move to a different product</li>
<li>Is the system even able to truly delete your data? (Some products cannot delete data without breaking the system)</li>

"A surprising takeaway for us has been that one of the primary users of our public data has been the museum itself. Easy access to our own data has enabled internal projects to be built on top of the published data, both because it’s in an easy-to-use form, but also because of the permissive license." &#x2013;Carnegie Museum <a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/facet2/">https://collectionsasdata.github.io/facet2/</a>

"You create an even higher risk if you start pulling different raw data sets into one central place. When you start doing that, you start building a profile of the patron’s use of the entire library. While this is the dream set up for some folks in your organization, such as your assessment people, marketing teams, and administration, this is also a set up that, if not done very carefully, puts the entire notion of library patron privacy at risk." &#x2013;Yoose, Wrangling Patron Data

<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-library-apis-datasets">Harvard LibraryCloud</a> &#x2013; "Harvard LibraryCloud is a metadata hub that provides granular, open access to a large aggregation of Harvard library bibliographic metadata.
</p>

<p>
The public LibraryCloud Item API supports searching LibraryCloud and obtaining results in a normalized MODS or Dublin Core format.
</p>

<p>
LibraryCloud contains records from Harvard's Alma instance (over 12.7M bib records), SharedShelf (4M image records), and ArchivesSpace finding aids (2M finding aid components). Alma metadata has additionally been enriched with the Stackscore usage metric, as well as holdings, and LC classification subject headings.
</p>

<p>
LibraryCloud also contains an alpha release of a Collections API, that is planned for use as a digital collection definition and export service. The Collection API allows a group of LibraryCloud records to be labeled as part of a named collection. The collection may then be harvested through OAI-PMH in order to import metadata into online digital exhibit platforms, such as Spotlight or DPLA. The full build out of the collection API and a collection builder web application is still a work in progress."
